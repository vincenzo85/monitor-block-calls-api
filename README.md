ðŸš€ **Enhancing Security and Performance in WordPress: Monitoring and Blocking API Calls** ðŸš€

As WordPress developers, we often need to keep tabs on API calls for debugging, optimization, and security. In my latest article, I dive into a step-by-step approach to **monitor all API calls** made by a WordPress site and **block calls to unwanted domains**. With ChatGPTâ€™s support, I crafted an efficient solution to log every API request, giving full visibility over site interactions and control over which external services can connect.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn:
ðŸ”¹ **Set up logging for all API requests**: Gain a clear view of every outgoing call, right from development to production.  
ðŸ”¹ **Block unwanted domains**: Prevent unnecessary or potentially harmful connections that may affect performance or security.  
ðŸ”¹ **SQL Query Tips**: Modify and extend the database to add a "status" column, differentiating between blocked and allowed calls.  
ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Extensions**: Options to implement an admin interface, dynamic configurations, real-time alerts, and more.

### Why It Matters:
- **Enhanced Security**: Control external connections to protect data and site performance.
- **Improved Performance**: Reduce unnecessary calls that may impact load times.
